<h5 id="about">About</h5>
<p>The Crypto can be used to send information encrypted. Before you begin conversation, all you need is:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Security Number and Security Passkey</li>
  <li>Your partner’s Silver Key.</li>
  <li>Your Silver Key.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="keys">Keys?</h5>
<p>On Cranberry (v3.01) edition, anybody who knew the names of the senders and reciever. This made it possible for a <em>third</em> person to find out your names, crack the encryption and read your messages! Now <strong>there’s no need of names!</strong>. Using Crypto will now require 3 keys to be exchanged, and voila! You can begin conversation with an encryption scheme <strong>that nobody can even guess!!</strong></p>

<h5 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Get a Security Number, Security Passkey and Silver Key generated.</li>
  <li>Send these to your Partner.</li>
  <li>She should directly enter these (she shouldnt generate another pair of Security Keys) in her program.</li>
  <li>The Silver Key which she gets should be shared to you.</li>
  <li>You enter these in your program.</li>
  <li>Voila! Begin the conversation!</li>
</ol>
