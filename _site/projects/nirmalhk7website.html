<p>Previously a simple website, now powered with Jekyll.</p>

<h5 id="nirmalhk7githubio">nirmalhk7.github.io</h5>
<p>The redesigned website is live, and the design is expected to be forever. I will continue adding JS elements to make it more cooler and faster. Also, the blog is now in-house!</p>

<h5 id="new-components">New Components</h5>
<p>The website uses components made by other developers, which I will acknowledge here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The theme: Hola by Styleshout.</li>
  <li>Animations: from Animista
    <ul>
      <li>Flickering Footer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Form: Simple Form</li>
</ul>
