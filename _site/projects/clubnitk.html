<p>Club Recruitment Portal for NITK. Under Development</p>

<h5 id="built-for-nitk">Built for NITK</h5>
<p>Among all clubs in NITK, there are 6 clubs which are called “exclusive clubs”, i.e. one can join only one of these 6 clubs. These clubs are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IEEE</li>
  <li>ACM</li>
  <li>IET</li>
  <li>IE</li>
  <li>ISTE</li>
  <li>Rotoract</li>
</ul>

<p>Every year almost all of 800 people (annual intake of NITK) apply for clubs. They have to order the clubs by their priority: from most wanted to least.</p>

<p>Since there is no transparent, bug-proof system existing, most people think they could tell different orders to different clubs to increase their likelihood of getting into any club. So club recruiters (3rd and 4th year students) have to spend a tonne of time to sort the final list out.</p>

<p>This year (2019), recruitment was done by Google Sheets, which was better than last year (chaos) but still inefficient.</p>

<h5 id="the-idea">The Idea</h5>
<p><a href="https://abhishekkumar2718.github.io">Abhishek Kumar</a> suggested me this idea for NIT Conclave 2019 Hackathon. I spoke to my club (IET NITK) head, and he confirmed my views.</p>

<p>Since we didnt do this in Conclave, I thought its best if I completed this project myself, also learning Ruby on Rails along the way.</p>
