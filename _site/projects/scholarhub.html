<h6 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h6>

<p>Despite the Government’s stress for R&amp;D across various sectors within India, we felt the researchers lacked a uniform platform to enlighten themselves to interact with their fellow researchers and to look for grants issued by Goverment and Universities</p>

<ul>
  <li>We realized the future of engineering lies in interdiscplinary pursuits: Knowledge in mutliple fields is essential. There is no central repository of research papers written by NIT scholars which we felt was a requirement in this age.</li>
  <li>Researchers when in need of a fellow researchers with a particular skillset have to resort to word of mouth. This restricts the pool of talent that can be accessed.</li>
  <li>Researchers have to rely on word of mouth and suggestions to find out about applicable grants, which is often too late.</li>
  <li>There is no central source of events and workshops of interest for NITs.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h6>

<p>The idea behind ScholarHub is to promote research culture within NIT’s by making information about funding, human resource development and provision of neccesary facilities at one central place.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This eliminates the need to go through another NIT’s research portal to find research papers.</li>
  <li>We provide a list of fellow researchers who are in need of collaborators. We provide enough personal information and a way of communication to identify right partners.</li>
  <li>We aggregrate information about upcoming events of interest across all NITs, enabling interested scholars to pursue more workshops.</li>
  <li>We provide a list of upcoming grants and their essential information that institutions and governments offer.</li>
</ul>
