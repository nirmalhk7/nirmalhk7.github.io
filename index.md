### Howdy!
I'm from India, and I'm second year student at National Institute of Technology, Karnataka. Programming, reading books, reading news, table tennis and **making applications that eliminate iterative work** is my hobby. I like to constantly challenge myself with problems. I also have a knack for finance and investment.

##### Academics
I completed my 10th grade in Bangalore with **9.4 CGPA** and my 12th grade with
87.9%. I currently study in **National Institute of Technology Karnataka** doing BTech in Information Technology and have <em>{{site.getCGPA }}</em> CGPA<small>(as of May 2019)</small>

##### Technical Projects and Activities
My projects are listed below. Most of them are open-sourced on GitHub. I've worked on several MERN Stack based, Native Android and Ruby on Rails projects. I'm also member Web Developer of IRIS NITK, which is NITK's student-run university management portal. I'm also passionate about Machine Learning and its applications.

##### Finance
I strongly think that the best way to earn more is to read more about exactly how money works. 
As a student, I love to read about money, stock markets and financial incidents around the world.
