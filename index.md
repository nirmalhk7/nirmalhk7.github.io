### Howdy!
I'm from India, and I'm second year student at National Institute of Technology, Karnataka. Programming, reading books, reading news, table tennis and **making applications that eliminate iterative work** is my hobby. I like to constantly challenge myself with problems. I also have a knack for finance and investment.
