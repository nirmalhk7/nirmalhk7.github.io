I'm a software engineer from Bengaluru, KA. From my experience, I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table in a variety of areas, including expertise in all major JavaScript frameworks, proficiency in Spring Boot, and both native and hybrid mobile development. I also have experience in cloud deployment and working with both SQL and NoSQL databases. In addition, I am eager to continue developing my understanding of software deployment and cloud architecture, and am always looking for new opportunities to expand my skillset in these areas.



Currently I'm pursuing a Masters of Science in Computer Science at University of Colorado Boulder.
