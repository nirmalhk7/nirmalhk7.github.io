Ever dreamed of having your own mini data center? Before diving into the exciting world of homelabs, you need a solid architecture plan. This crucial planning stage helps you avoid costly mistakes and ensures your homelab meets your actual needs.

After [setting up my hardware](/blog/homelab_how_to_choose), I realized I needed a more thoughtful software strategy. I divided my homelab into three distinct environments:

- **Managed**: Critical services with tight controls and minimal chaos. These are only accessible via VPN for maximum security.
- **Dev**: Experimental services and testing grounds (maximum chaos welcome!). Limited to LAN or VPN access only.
- **Live**: Internet-exposed applications with strict controls to ensure reliability and security.

Before proceeding with your own homelab, create a similar framework. Think about what service groups you need and how you'll manage access control for each.

## Choosing Your Operating System

My primary goal was running everything on Kubernetes clusters. After working with both approaches professionally, I'm convinced that for most production applications, Kubernetes offers significant advantages over traditional VMs.

However, Kubernetes doesn't install directly on bare metal—you need an underlying OS. Your options include:

- **Desktop OS**: A terrible choice for servers as the GUI consumes valuable resources while providing little benefit.
- **Server OS**: A solid option that balances functionality and resource efficiency.
- **Level 1 hypervisors**: An operating system specifically designed to run multiple VMs efficiently.

As a relative newcomer to homelab architecture, I opted for a server OS approach.

## Selecting the Right Server OS

When choosing a server OS, remember that homelabs are rarely about the underlying system—they're about the applications running on top. The ideal OS is lightweight yet adaptable.

For my Kubernetes-focused setup, Debian was the perfect fit. Other excellent options include Alpine Linux for extreme minimalism or Talos OS (designed specifically for Kubernetes). It's worth noting that Talos makes trade-offs for its Kubernetes optimization—you'll lose common features like SSH tunneling that many take for granted.

## Deployment Strategy

With your OS in place, you have several deployment options:

- **Running services directly on the OS**: Avoid this approach—it creates maintenance nightmares and dependency conflicts.
- **Dockerized services**: Better than bare metal but requires significant management overhead.
- **Cluster-based services**: Ideal for most applications, though certain workloads like gaming servers or specialized databases may present challenges.

I'll be honest—while VMs have their place, my professional experience at Visa showed they're often more trouble than they're worth. For most scenarios, a well-configured Kubernetes cluster provides better reliability and simpler maintenance.

## What's Next for My Homelab?

I'm excited to implement a comprehensive suite of services including:
- Photo and document sharing
- Media streaming
- Gaming servers
- Bug tracking
- Log search and analysis
- Monitoring and observability tools

Having worked with powerful internal tools at Visa, I'm eager to build similar capabilities for my personal projects. Beyond just using these services, I plan to actively develop and extend several of them.

I'll also be exploring modern DevOps approaches like GitOps, which should streamline deployments and configuration management. The journey ahead promises plenty of planning, development challenges, and—most importantly—fun!

Stay tuned for my next update as this homelab adventure continues!
