There's a unique difference between the art of speaking and the art of writing, isn't it? Despite the fact that both require creativity, the challenges of speaking (stage-fright, body language) is much different from the ones in writing.

Speaking is spontaneous, and the fright you get when you see a room full of eyes is real, writing cannot replicate that. But writing is something that is recorded forever: you risk putting your thoughts/ ideas out incorrectly if you do it wrong. Or even worse: you could end up hurting someone.

I've never been uncomfortable to speak in crowd: I'm not a *great* speaker, but I don't have stage-fright as such. I love the challenge speaking provides. But I can't say the same about writing and I want to fix that in me. Writing technical documents and Confluence wikis is one thing, but writing freehand about topics is ... jeez how do people think of what to write? How do people write so well ...

That's what this is to fix, and this is what I want to use this blog for.

# Writing
This article is meant to mark the start of my writing journey. I've always been interested in the "bringing to real life" aspect of software engineering: its all nice and fun when it works on localhost, but the sheer engineering required to secure and scale anything big is just mesmerizing for me. And it gets even better at bigger scale. Where I last worked in Visa for example, absolutely no downtime can be tolerated anytime. All releases are done without disrupting uptime and with proper backup options.

This is where the name **"The Blue Green Manual"** comes  comes in. Named after the deployment process, I'm in hunt for learning all processes that make production software production grade, and this blog will be a documentation of everything I've learnt. It could be just concepts, or it could be my new hobby as a homelabber, or it could be something entirely different.
