###### Problem Statement

Despite the Government's stress for R&D across various sectors within India, we felt the researchers lacked a uniform platform to enlighten themselves to interact with their fellow researchers and to look for grants issued by Goverment and Universities

- We realized the future of engineering lies in interdiscplinary pursuits: Knowledge in mutliple fields is essential. There is no central repository of research papers written by NIT scholars which we felt was a requirement in this age.
- Researchers when in need of a fellow researchers with a particular skillset have to resort to word of mouth. This restricts the pool of talent that can be accessed.
- Researchers have to rely on word of mouth and suggestions to find out about applicable grants, which is often too late.
- There is no central source of events and workshops of interest for NITs.

###### Our Solution

The idea behind ScholarHub is to promote research culture within NIT's by making information about funding, human resource development and provision of neccesary facilities at one central place.

- This eliminates the need to go through another NIT's research portal to find research papers.
- We provide a list of fellow researchers who are in need of collaborators. We provide enough personal information and a way of communication to identify right partners.
- We aggregrate information about upcoming events of interest across all NITs, enabling interested scholars to pursue more workshops.
- We provide a list of upcoming grants and their essential information that institutions and governments offer.
