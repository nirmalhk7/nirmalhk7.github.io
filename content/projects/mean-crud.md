# Employee Appraisal Form
This is a practical assignment done by me (Nirmal Khedkar) for Web Technologies and Applications (WTA).

## Basic Functionality Description
Bosses and their employees register with their email and password. Employees register with their boss email as well. Bosses get all employees registered under them and can create/read/update/delete their appraisal on them. Employees get their details and appraisal (if done) when they log in.

## Installation Guidelines
Requirements:
- NodeJS
- MongoDB (sudo apt install mongodb)

Steps:
- Do `npm install` in project directory.
- Run MongoDB server.
- If you want to try out with dummy accounts, please run the dummy.js file (`node dummy.js`). If done, two accounts with boss credentials `admin@admin.com` (pswd: `admin`) and `nirmal@nirmal.com` (pswd: `nirmal`) are created. 
- `npm start`. Open https://localhost:3000 in your browser of choice.
