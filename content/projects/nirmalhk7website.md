Previously a simple website, now powered with Jekyll.

##### nirmalhk7.github.io
The redesigned website is live, and the design is expected to be forever. I will continue adding JS elements to make it more cooler and faster. Also, the blog is now in-house!

##### New Components
The website uses components made by other developers, which I will acknowledge here:
* The theme: Hola by Styleshout.
* Wallpaper: Beast Dreams II By Justin Maller
* Animations: from Animista
  * Flickering Footer
  * Heartbeat
* Form: Simple Form

##### Made By
Nirmal Khedkar
